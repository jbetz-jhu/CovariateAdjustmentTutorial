# Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Trials
### Worked Examples using Simulated CTN03 Trial Data

This repo contains data and code to illustrate how to perform covariate-adjusted analyses in randomized trials using the [R package for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). If you are just interested in viewing the explanations, code, and results, simply [download the repository](https://github.com/jbetz-jhu/CovariateAdjustmentTutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and open it in your browser.

The .Zip file will contain an HTML report contains the code and additional explanations and references. If you want to run the code yourself, you will need to [download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) *and have an active internet connection while the code is running*. The [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) development is not required to run the code, but is highly recommended for using R most effectively. Some additional packages will need to be installed from the [Comprehensive R Archival Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/): this can be done from the command line using the code provided. The code involves downloading the example data and some additional code from Github, which is why an active internet connection is required.
